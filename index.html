        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello,I am a passionate web developer with a love for creating interactive and user-friendly websites. My journey in the world of web development began with a curiosity to understand how websites work and has since evolved into a rewarding career.</p>
    
        <p>I specialize in front-end development, where I bring designs to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy the creative process of crafting visually appealing and functional web experiences that leave a positive impact on users.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, keeping up with the latest web development trends, or simply enjoying a good cup of coffee while brainstorming new ideas for my next project.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work and learning more about my journey in web development.</p>
